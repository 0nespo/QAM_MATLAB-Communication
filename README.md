# QAM_MATLAB-Communication


This code provide two codes in this directory. The first code implements Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) with 16, 32, 64, and 128 levels, comparing the differences by introducing Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and analyzing their respective outputs. In the second code, I compare QAM modulations with On-Off Keying (OOK) and Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). Additionally, I introduce two distinct Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values to evaluate the impact of SNR during the modulation implementation.
